Welcome to my question-writing guide! The aim of this document is to give you a practical idea on what dynamic questions are, how they differ to the usual 'static' questions, and provide some coding techniques that will hopefully make the process of writing questions easier.

{{<hint warning>}}
The guide is currently **incomplete**; only **Sections 1 and 2** of this guide have been properly written. 
{{</hint>}}

Regarding prerequisites: For Sections 1 and 2, knowledge of basic HTML syntax and [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org/) would be useful. From Section 3, I'll begin including snippets of PHP code to aid with explanations - knowledge of arrays, conditionals (`if`/`else`), loops (`for`/`while`), and functions will probably be required then.

If you have any questions or confusions while reading this, please feel free to [contact me](other/contact)! The guide is still pretty new and I'm sure there'll be quite a few spots I've forgotten to clear up.

Please note that this document is **not** meant to be read all at once! I've intended it as something that you can frequently come back to if you're ever stuck on something. 

* Section 1 (the introduction) talks about how to use the QBM itself;
* Section 2 focuses on general dos and don'ts with designing and coding questions;
* The remaining sections will cover more specific situations that arise with certain kinds of math questions. 

If you've already read the [original QBM guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xsDG-wY8beKBJlu3HIUPtWc1J-W7EY13KjDiEcgJhY/edit) and just want a quick look at some new advice with dynamic questions in general, then you might want to begin with [2.1. Common Issues with Dynamic Questions](#21-common-issues-with-dynamic-questions) and [2.2. General Design Guidelines](#22-general-design-guidelines)!
