title: 3. Coding Examples
---

Right - after going all the design talk above, I should probably start talking about the actual code itself and how the design principles above can be used in practice. 

In this section, I'll go through several specific examples of code used in actual questions. 

The things covered will include: 

1. How to solve the common issues listed in [section 2.1](#21-common-issues-with-dynamic-questions). 
2. Example Question 1: Finding volume of a sphere, given its SA
3. Example Question 2: Simplifying an inequality

There'll be a bunch of PHP code snippets here, so this is where some knowledge of PHP syntax would help with understanding the content more quickly. If possible, you might also want to try running some of the code yourself and experimenting with it to see what happens! 

If anything doesn't work, feel free to [contact me](/other/contact).

On the topic of running PHP code, the following site is a good place to directly test these snippets yourself: \

Make sure to encase your code in the `<?php` and `?>` tags for it to run properly!
