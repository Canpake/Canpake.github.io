<!-- Multiple-choice questions have additional considerations due to the fact that you need to provide random wrong answers.

On one hand, the answers you give for multiple-choice questions can't be *completely* random - otherwise the correct answer can be plainly obvious:

On the other hand, care is also needed when giving wrong answers that relate to the question - otherwise your wrong answers might be duplicates of each other, or even a correct solution themselves!

This is an issue even if it rarely occurs, as thousands of students are going to be seeing these questions, and it's likely that they'll come across the problem at least once.

A few techniques in [4.1. Introducing 'Randomness'](#41-introducing-randomness) can help you avoid getting duplicate values, but once again, the best option is to design your question such that it never comes across this issue in the first place.
