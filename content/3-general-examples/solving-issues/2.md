<!-- 
This is a general problem with most computing languages, and you can replicate this one yourself with the following code:
```php
echo 3.14159265 - 3.14;
```
You'll find that PHP does something strange here and returns the value `0.0015926500000001`. 

Why it does this is explained at length here: \

But, in a nutshell, arithmetic in computers done in base 2 rather than base 10, which can lead to some rounding errors on decimals like these ones.

Generally, you'll only need to worry about this in PHP when very small decimals are involved. Once again, consider rounding your values or designing the question to avoid this situation entirely. -->
