## Context: Real-World Graphs

This is an **open-answer** question that will use graphs to show a constant rate of exchange between two items. 

In this case, the structure of the question will be something like this: 

> Two farms, Farm A and Farm B, sell cherries at a constant rate per kilogram. The prices of these two suppliers are shown in the graph below. 
> 
> [a graph of 2 straight lines, $$y = Ax$$ (labelled 'farm A') and $$y = Bx$$ (labelled 'farm B') for some values $$A > B$$]
> 
> Last month, a restaurant spent [$C] buying cherries from Farm A. How much would they have saved by buying from Farm B instead?

## Approach

This question is solved in a pretty straightforward manner: 

1. Figure out the values of $$A$$ and $$B$$ from the graph (look at gradients)
2. Figure out the number of kilograms of cherries bought: $$ {C \over A} $$
3. Figure out the amount saved with each kilogram of cherries: $$ A - B $$
4. $$ \text{[total saved]} = \text{[kilograms of cherries bought]} \times \text{[amount saved per kilogram]} = {C \over A} \times (A - B)$$. 

The maths is fairly simple here - and we can ensure the answer is always a whole number by making $$C$$ some multiple of $$A$$. 

The difficult part here is making the graph - and this is where using JSXGraph comes in. 

In this case, with our diagram, we want lines on an axes - and thankfully, the JSXGraph library provides a pretty intuitive way of doing this. 

{{<hint info>}}
The JSXGraph documentation has a lot of information about the different things you can put onto a diagram. It can be found here: \
https://jsxgraph.org/docs/index.html

In this case, some useful links to look at would be: 
- For the axes, the board object itself: https://jsxgraph.org/docs/symbols/JXG.Board.html
- For the lines, a 'functiongraph': https://jsxgraph.org/docs/symbols/Functiongraph.html

You might also see that there's documentation for a 'line' object - however, I won't be using it in this case because I want to demonstrate the use of a Functiongraph (which is a lot more flexible). 
{{</hint>}}

## Coding the Question

Let's get started on the variables we can randomise first - A, B, and C. There are a few explicit restrictions on our randomisation: 
- A must be greater than B
- A must be a factor of C

However, is this all? Another thing to note is that **some values of A or B are much easier to solve for**. 

Consider a graph where the axes are marked in increments of 10 - the gradient of the graph $$y = 20x$$ would be much easier to find compared to $$y = 27x$$. 

Because of this, in order to make difficulty consistent, I'll keep the values of A and B divisible by 5. \

We can randomise this and also generate our answer directly:

```php
// Cost of 1kg cherries for farm A and farm B
$A = mt_rand(5, 10);
$B = mt_rand(2, $A - 2);       // B always smaller than A

// make $A and $B divisible by 5
$A *= 5;
$B *= 5;

// Kilos of cherries bought
$kilos_bought = mt_rand(4, 9);

// Find difference between amount spent at farm A vs farm B
$spentA = $A * $kilos_bought;   
$spentB = $B * $kilos_bought;
$answer = $spentA - $spentB;
```

As you can see, the maximum range of the variable `$B` is decided by `$A` to ensure it is always smaller. We also multiply their values by 5 at the end so that they're always divisible by 5.

Meanwhile, instead of randomly generating C (or rather, `$spentA` in this case), I've instead generated `$kilos_bought` as its own variable, so that `$spentA` is always some multiple of `$A`. It also allows us to calculate the answer very clearly. 

Next comes the question text - in this case, I'll add in an extra `<div>` element at the end, which is where the JSXGraph diagram will come in. 

{{<hint info>}}
When making the div element, a few things to note about the attributes: 
- The `id` attribute can be anything you want - this will be used in your code as well. 
- The `class` attribute **must** be `jxgbox` - this is required for the JSXGraph library to work with it. 
- The `style` attribute **must** include the width and height as you see below to display properly. I recommend using equal width and height; `400px` is generally big enough. 
{{</hint>}}

```php
$question_text = "Two farms, Farm A and Farm B, sell cherries at a constant rate per kilogram. The prices of these two suppliers are shown in the graph below. <br>"
               . "Last month, a restaurant spent `$$spentA` buying cherries from Farm A. How much would they have saved by buying from Farm B instead? <br>"
               . "<div id='graph' class='jxgbox' style='width:400px; height:400px'></div>";
```

And also the solution text - I've defined an extra variable `$AB_diff` as the difference between `$A` and `$B` in order to show the calculations in the middle. Note the use of two dollar signs for currencies - `$$A` becomes `$5`, for example!

```php
$AB_diff = $A - $B;

$solution = "Looking at the graph, Farm A charges `$$A` per kilogram of cherries, while Farm B charges `$$B` per kilogram of cherries. <br>"
          . "The restaurant spent `$$spentA` buying cherries from Farm A, so they bought `$spentA / $A = $kilos_bought` kilograms of cherries. <br>"
          . "They would save `$$A - $$B = $$AB_diff` per kilogram of cherries bought from farm B. <br>"
          . "Therefore, by buying from farm B instead, they would have saved `$$AB_diff times $kilos_bought = $$answer` dollars in total.";
```

Now, to include the actual diagram in the question, we'll need to include JS code that uses the JSXGraph library. 

As explained in [the previous page](/4-advanced-examples), I'll use a Heredoc to contain the relevant scripts - it should be something like this: 

```php
$script = <<<SCRIPT
// HTML to include the JSXGraph Library
<script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraphcore.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsxgraph/distrib/jsxgraph.css" />

// JS Code for the diagram goes here! 
<script>
    // your code
</script>
SCRIPT;
```

The first two `<script>` and `<link>` tags are used to include the JSXGraph library; these will always be included. 

The next bit is what decides the things that appear in the diagram. 

To include the randomised variables from PHP, note that this is still a string - we can still substitute PHP variables directly into it, like this: 

```js
let A = $A;
let B = $B;
```

Next up, let's define the box - we'll also need to think about the x/y ranges of our graph. 

In this case, I'll show values of $$x$$ from -1 to 8 so there are sufficiently enough values to look at. \
Then, for the y-range, since we'll be graphing $$y = Ax$$ and $$y = Bx$$ with $$A > B$$, I'll set it from -A to 8A so that the lines fit properly. 

```js
let box = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('graph', {boundingbox: [-1, A*8, 8, -A], showNavigation: false, axis: true});
```

The `'graph'` argument corresponds to the `id` attribute of the `<div>` in `$question_text`. Meanwhile, the rest of the arguments are supplied inside curly brackets:
- The `boundingbox` decides the top-left `(-1, A*8)` and bottom-right `(8, -A)` coordinates of the axes.
- `showNavigation` is `false`, mainly to remove clutter from the page
- `axis` is `true` to provide us with an automatic axis on the graph

Right now, with this code, we get a diagram looks like this (if A = 30): 

<div id="ex1" class="jxgbox" style="width:400px; height:400px;"></div>

<script>
    let box = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('ex1', {boundingbox: [-1, 240, 8, -30], showNavigation: false, axis: true});
</script>

Now we just need to add in the lines (and the appropriate labels) - we can use the `.create()` method on the `box` we just created: 

```js
let lineA = box.create('functiongraph', [(n) => {return A*n}, 0, 10], {name: "Farm A", withLabel: true, label: {position: 'bot', offset: [50, 100]}, color: 'black', strokeWidth: 2});
let lineB = box.create('functiongraph', [(n) => {return B*n}, 0, 10], {name: "Farm B", withLabel: true, label: {position: 'bot', offset: [100, 50]}, color: 'blue', strokeWidth: 2});
```

With each time we call the method, we give it the following arguments: 
- The first argument is the string `"functiongraph"` to specify that we want a functiongraph object; 
- The second argument is an array of 3 values `[(n) => {return A*n}, 0, 10]`. 
  - The first value, `(n) => {return A*n}`, is a function - in this case, it's the line $$y = Ax$$
  - The second and third values, 0 and 10, specify the range of values that this function will be run on. \
    Since the x-values on the graph are from -1 to 8, the lines will start from 0 and continue all the way to the right.
- The third argument includes our other generic arguments that modify how our function looks: 
  - We set a `name` and `withLabel: true` to display the "Farm A/B" text next to the line
  - The location of the label is set through the `label` argument itself - the offset is in pixels.
  - Line colour is controlled with `color`
  - Line width is controlled with `strokeWidth`

With these two extra lines, our graph now looks like this (given A = 30, B = 20): 

<div id="ex2" class="jxgbox" style="width:400px; height:400px;"></div>

<script>
let box2 = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard('ex2', {boundingbox: [-1, 330, 11, -30], showNavigation: false, axis: true});
let lineA = box2.create('functiongraph', [(n) => {return A*n}, 0, 10], {name: "Farm A", withLabel: true, label: {position: 'bot', offset: [50, 100]}, color: 'black', strokeWidth: 2});
let lineB = box2.create('functiongraph', [(n) => {return B*n}, 0, 10], {name: "Farm B", withLabel: true, label: {position: 'bot', offset: [100, 50]}, color: 'blue', strokeWidth: 2});
;
</script>

And we're done with the diagram! \
(Well, there's still more if you want to include axis labels and stuff like that - but I guess I'll leave that as an exercise to the reader ðŸ˜›)

Just remember to echo out the actual question text and the script:

## Final Question Code

So let's put everything together now, in the question box: 

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
// Cost of 1kg cherries for farm A and farm B
$A = mt_rand(5, 10);
$B = mt_rand(2, $A - 2);       // B always smaller than A

// make $A and $B divisible by 5
$A *= 5;
$B *= 5;

// Kilos of cherries bought
$kilos_bought = mt_rand(5, 10);

// Find difference between amount spent at farm A vs farm B
$spentA = $A * $kilos_bought;   
$spentB = $B * $kilos_bought;
$answer = $spentA - $spentB;

// Question text and solution
$question_text = "Two farms, Farm A and Farm B, sell cherries at a constant rate per kilogram. The prices of these two suppliers are shown in the graph below. <br>"
               . "Last month, a restaurant spent `$$spentA` buying cherries from Farm A. How much would they have saved by buying from Farm B instead? <br>"
               . "<div id='graph' class='jxgbox' style='width:400px; height:400px'></div>";

$AB_diff = $A - $B;

$solution = "Looking at the graph, Farm A charges `$$A` per kilogram of cherries, while Farm B charges `$$B` per kilogram of cherries. <br>"
          . "The restaurant spent `$$spentA` buying cherries from Farm A, so they bought `$spentA / $A = $kilos_bought` kilograms of cherries. <br>"
          . "They would save `$$A - $$B = $$AB_diff` per kilogram of cherries bought from farm B. <br>"
          . "Therefore, by buying from farm B instead, they would have saved `$$AB_diff times $kilos_bought = $$answer` dollars in total.";
