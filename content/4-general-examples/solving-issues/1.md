title: 4.3.1. INFs and unrounded answers

Here's the example that was shown back in [section 2.1](/2-design/common-issues):

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DYm97LY.png" width="500px"/>

In the above case, the formula for the volume of a sphere was directly used to calculate and display the answer. \
Let's look at the code involved: 

```php
$radius = mt_rand(5, 15);
$answer = 4 / 3 * pi() * ($radius ** 3);
```

While this seems fine at first, using `pi()` in calculations will give you messy numbers, and PHP will attempt to respond with as much precision as it can - giving us a number with 10 or so decimal places. Oops!

Generally, there are 2 approaches to solve this problem: 

1. **Ask for a rounded solution** - either to a certain number of decimal places or significant figures.
2. **Express the solution exactly** - in this case, in terms of $$ \pi $$.

## Option 1: Asking for a Rounded Solution

<!-- TODO: Include examples for dealing with SFs -->

This one is the simple approach and works alright for most cases. 

In the above case, we could add the following text to the question: \
*"Round your answer to 2 decimal places (if necessary)."*

To get our rounded answer in code, we can simply add a slight modification to the answer calculation: 
```php
$answer = round(4 / 3 * pi() * ($radius ** 3), 2);
```
So in a case where `$radius` is set to `10` like above, we'd get an answer of `4188.79`. 

The solution involves a bit more work, though - you should also be showing the process of rounding the value. \
For example: 
```php
$answer_round4 = round(4 / 3 * pi() * ($radius ** 3), 4);
$solution_text = "`(4/3) pi r^3 = (4/3) pi ($radius)^3 = $answer_round4... approx $answer."
```

Here, I've defined an extra variable that shows the answer rounded to a greater number of decimal places. 

This will give a clear, step-by-step solution - for example, if `$radius = 10`: 

$$
{4 \over 3} \pi r^3 = {4 \over 3} \pi (10)^3 = 4188.7902... \approx 4188.79.
$$

{{<hint warning>}}
Be careful when you use this method of showing the working out! 

In cases where the answer does not need to be rounded, you might end up showing something like this: 

$$
6.25 \cdot 6 = 37.5... \approx 37.5
$$

The above solution doesn't make sense - it rounds for no reason and says 37.5 is approximately equal to... itself? 

Because of this, it's important to first check whether your answer actually needs to be rounded. \
One way of doing this is by comparing the rounded answer to itself, like this: 
```php
if (round($answer, 2) == $answer) { 
    // do not show rounding
} else {
    // do show rounding
}
```
{{</hint>}}

## Option 2: Expressing the Solution Exactly

Meanwhile, in the case of option 2, you'll want to express this as a fraction that uses $$ \pi $$. 

A basic way of including the fraction would be to do this: 
```php
$answer_numer = 4 * ($radius ** 3);  # Numerator of the fraction
$answer_denom = 3;                   # Denominator of the fraction

$answer = "`($answer_numer / $answer_denom) pi`";
```

In the case where `$radius` is set to `10`, like above, you would end up with the following answer: 

$$
{4000 \over 3} \pi 
$$

However, there's a bit of a problem here - what if the radius is divisible by 3? You'll end up displaying a fraction that's **not in its simplest form**. For example, if `$radius` was `3`, then you would end up with the following: 

$$
{108 \over 3} \pi 
$$

This isn't very good - it should be $$36 \pi$$ instead! 

Because of this, you'll want to express your answer differently whenever the numerator is divisible by 3.

One way of doing this would be as follows: 
```php
$answer_numer = 4 * ($radius ** 3);  # This calculates 4r^3, the numerator

if ($answer_numer % 3 == 0) {        # if divisible by 3, display as a whole number
    $answer_coef = $answer_numer / 3;
    $answer = "`$answer_coef pi`";
} else {                             # otherwise, display as a fraction
    $answer = "`($answer_numer / 3) pi`";
}
```

Now, in a case where `$radius` is divisible by 3, you'll be showing a whole number rather than a fraction.
