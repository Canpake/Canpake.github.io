title: 4.3.3. Weird random values

Unfortunately, the description of this issue is a bit vague as it can show up in a variety of forms. 

The issue is to do with the values in a question that come from random generation, where they end up either: 

- Making no sense in the context that they're used in
- Providing an alternative, unintended way of solving the question 

There are numerous examples of how these can arise in various situations - to give you an idea of what I mean, here's a few examples of each: 

- 

<!-- When writing a static question, the numbers chosen generally follow a number of implicit assumptions, such as: 

- If a question involves finding GCD/LCM of 2 numbers, the values given should be different
- When calculating an answer in currency, the final answer should be in the proper denominations (i.e. not having 0.001 USD, or 0.5 JPY).

Some of these are harder to deal with - such as picking 3 random points on a grid and making sure they form a triangle, not a line. The randomisation methods covered in [4.1. Introducing 'Randomness'](#41-introducing-randomness) may be able to help out with this.

If you forget to check for these conditions when randomising your values, then often you end up with a question that either sounds weird, or no longer assesses what was originally intended:

> The aim in the above question is for students learn how to calculate distance when several speeds are given - but this does not apply if the speeds given are the same! -->
