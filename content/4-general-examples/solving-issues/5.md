<!-- When randomising your numbers, some values might lead to a question that requires much harder calculations or even an entirely different solving method.

For example, consider finding the roots of `f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1`, compared to `f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 2`!

The former can be factorised and solved immediately, whereas the other requires the quadratic formula and also has complex roots - overall much harder to solve.

This ties in with the above point about 'implicit assumptions' as well. If you're giving side lengths and angles of a triangle for a question about the cosine rule, make sure you avoid angles like 90Ëš - this would mean they could use Pythagoareas' Theorem instead!  -->
