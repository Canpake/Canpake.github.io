## Context: Simplifying an inequality

We'll be looking at an **open-answer** question that involves giving an inequality with a single variable, and asking for the simplified form of the inequality. 

The inequality we'll give should be of one of the forms (where the boxes represent some random numbers): 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Box (\Box x + \Box) &< \Box \\
\Box (\Box x + \Box) &> \Box
\end{aligned}
$$

So an example question and solution might look something like this: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Question:} &  \\
&& 5(4x + 8) &< 120 \\
\text{Solution:} &  \\
&& 20x + 40 &< 120  \\
&& 20x      &< 80   \\
&& x        &< 4    \\
\end{aligned}
$$

We can use algebra to figure out the answer in terms of the random values. Naming them as $$A, B, C, D$$, note that: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
A(Bx + C)   &< D   \\
ABx + AC    &< D   \\
x &< \frac{D - AC}{AB}  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The same is true for the opposite inequality where $$>$$ is used. 

From the above calculations, there are several things to note here: 

1. We can control the final inequality so that **we always have an integer on the RHS** - i.e. $$x < E$$ for some integer $$E$$. We just need to choose a suitable value for $$D$$ so that $$D - AC$$ is a multiple of $$AB$$.
    - We can do this by generating a random values $$A, B, C, E$$, with $$E$$ as the **answer** $$x < E$$.
    - From this, we can figure out the value of $$D$$ such that $$(D - AC) \div AB = E$$, i.e. $$D = E(AB) + AC$$. \
      {{<hint info>}}
By ensuring that our answer only involves integers, it makes writing the solution a lot easier, while keeping the difficulty of the question a lot more consistent. 
      {{</hint>}}

2. The solution process doesn't change depending on whether the inequality is less than ($$<$$) or greater than ($$>$$), so we can generate that separately. 

## Coding the Question

As noted in point 1 above, we can generate the values $$A, B, C, E$$ (used for the answer), and the sign randomly. From the generated values, we can calculate what $$D$$ should be.

So let's generate some suitable values for the variables: 

```php
$A = mt_rand(2, 9);
$B = mt_rand(2, 9);
$C = mt_rand(2, 9);
$E = mt_rand(2, 9);
$sign = mt_rand(0, 1) ? ">" : "<";
```
{{<hint info>}}
Note: The final line generating `$sign` uses the [ternary operator](https://stitcher.io/blog/shorthand-comparisons-in-php#ternary-operator). \
If `mt_rand(0, 1)` returns 0, then the condition is false and `$sign = "<"`; otherwise the condition is true and `$sign = ">"`. 
{{</hint>}}

Then, we know that $$D = E(AB) + AC$$, so we can calculate that directly: 
```php
$D = ($E * $A * $B) + ($A * $C);
```

Now we can use the values to generate our question text, **making sure to explain how the answer should be formatted**: 
```php
$question_text = "Simplify the following inequality: `$A($B x + $C) $sign $D`. " 
               . "Your answer should be in the form `x $sign A` for some value A.";
```

The values also allow us to generate our answer pretty easily: 
```php
$answer = "`x $sign $E`";
```

The solution, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated, as we'll need to show step-by-step instructions (just like as seen in the example above with $$5(4x + 8) < 120$$). 

To do so, we'll need to calculate some of the intermediate values so that we can display them in the solution as well: 

```php
$AB = $A * $B;
$AC = $A * $C;
$D_AC = $D - $AC;

$solution = "Expand LHS: `$AB x + $AC $sign $D` <br>"
          . "`=> $AB x $sign $D - $AC` <br>"
          . "`=> x $sign ($D_AC)/$AB` <br>"
          . "`=> x $sign $E`";
```

And finally, echo the question text itself (since this is the question box):

```php
echo $question_text;
```

## Final Question Code

The final code for the question is as follows. A few comments have been added, and lines have been moved around to make the code easier to read. 

In the question box (again, all the generation is here, so that it's easier to see where values come from):

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
// set up inequality in the form of A(Bx+C)>D or A(Bx+C)<D, with answer x>E or x<E
$A = mt_rand(2, 9);
$B = mt_rand(2, 9);
$C = mt_rand(2, 9);
$E = mt_rand(2, 9);
$sign = mt_rand(0, 1) ? ">" : "<";

$D = ($E * $A * $B) + ($A * $C);

// question text
$question_text = "Simplify the following inequality: `$A($B x + $C) $sign $D`. " 
               . "Your answer should be in the form `x $sign A` for some value A.";

// generate answer + solution
$AB = $A * $B;
$AC = $A * $C;
$D_AC = $D - $AC;

$answer = "`x $sign $E`";
$solution = "Expand LHS: `$AB x + $AC $sign $D` <br>"
          . "`=> $AB x $sign $D - $AC` <br>"
          . "`=> x $sign ($D_AC)/$AB` <br>"
          . "`=> x $sign $E`";

echo $question_text; 
?>
{{</highlight>}}

And now the answer and solution boxes require very little code, as all the work has been done above: 

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
echo $answer;
?>
{{</highlight>}}

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
echo $solution;
?>
{{</highlight>}}

## Results

The question itself has $$8^4 = 4096$$ variations as we've randomised the values of $$A, B, C, E$$! Here are 3 examples of how the questions look like when shown:
