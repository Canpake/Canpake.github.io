title: 1.5. Useful Editor Features
---

The PHP editor is actually just a fancier version of the default 'HTML Source' editor. Apart from **syntax highlighting** and **autocompletion**, there's a few additional features of the editor that can allow you to write and edit code faster, including **auto-indentation** and  a bunch of **keyboard shortcuts**. 

Some main useful shortcuts will probably be these: 

Windows | Mac | Action
:--- | :--- | :---
Alt-Shift-Up/Down | Command-Option-Up/Down | Copy (selected) lines up/down
Alt-Up/Down | Option-Up/Down | Move (selected) lines up/down
Tab | Tab | Indent (selection)
Shift-Tab | Shift-Tab | Outdent (selection)
Ctrl-Click | Command-Click | Add another cursor at clicked location
Ctrl-Alt-Up/Down | Ctrl-Option-Up/Down | Add another cursor above/below the current cursor(s)
Ctrl-F | Command-F | Find
Ctrl-H | Command-Option-F | Replace
