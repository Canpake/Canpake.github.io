The general mathematics behind this is fairly straightforward. We can use the two formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere, given radius \(r\):
\[ \begin{aligned} SA &amp;= 4 \pi r^2 \\ V &amp;= {4 \pi r^3 \over 3} \\ \end{aligned} \]</description></item><item><title>3.2.

The inequality we'll give should be of one of the forms (where the boxes represent some random numbers):
\[ \begin{aligned} \Box (\Box x + \Box) &amp;\Box \end{aligned} \]
So an example question and solution might look something like this:
\[ \begin{aligned} \text{Question:} &amp; \\ &amp;&amp; 5(4x + 8) &amp;We can use algebra to figure out the answer in terms of the random values.</description></item></channel></rss>
