In the above case, the formula for the volume of a sphere was directly used to calculate and display the answer. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the code involved:
$radius = mt_rand(5, 15); $answer = 4 / 3 * pi() * ($radius ** 3); While this seems fine at first, using pi() in calculations will give you messy numbers, and PHP will attempt to respond with as much precision as it can - giving us a number with 10 or so decimal places.</description></item><item><title>4.3.2. Floating-point errors</title><link>https://canpake.github.io/wiki/4-general-examples/solving-issues/2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://canpake.github.io/wiki/4-general-examples/solving-issues/2/</guid><description>Floating-point errors, in summary, are basically where the computer makes tiny errors when doing arithmetic with decimals.
A rather specific example was given previously, but note that these issues can occur with simple decimal values as well. You can try this yourself:
Go to repl.it/languages/php_cli, and put this into the interpreter to see what you get:
&amp;lt;?php echo 0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3; ?&amp;gt;Rather than 0, we get a value that&amp;rsquo;s very close to it - 5.</description></item><item><title>4.3.3.

The aim in the above question is for students learn how to calculate distance when several speeds are given - but this does not apply if the speeds given are the same! --</description></item><item><title>4.3.4.

**Note:** As said in section 1, the order of solutions is randomised by default; this does not count as 'randomisation' in a dynamic question. As a rule of thumb, it would be good to have at least 20 possible variations of your question. More randomisation is better, but be careful of the next issue: --</description></item><item><title>4.3.5.

On the other hand, care is also needed when giving wrong answers that relate to the question - otherwise your wrong answers might be duplicates of each other, or even a correct solution themselves! This is an issue even if it rarely occurs, as thousands of students are going to be seeing these questions, and it's likely that they'll come across the problem at least once.</description></item></channel></rss>
