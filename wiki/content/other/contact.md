If there's stuff that doesn't quite make sense or seems wrong, feel free to send me a message! While I'll try to respond as soon as I can, do note that there are a *lot* of resources online that can help as well. 

Here are a few ways to contact me: 

- Find me on the [EV Slack](eunoiaventures.slack.com)!
  - Send a DM, or to the channel `#wmc-questions` or `#omc-questions`. 
- Email: jyim1120@gmail.com
- Messenger: jonathan.yim.121

Also note that there are other question writers on the Slack channel you can ask for help!
