title: 2. Dynamic Question Design
---

This section looks at how you might go about designing dynamic questions in general so that they can fit our competitions well. 

The reason why I've included this section on its own is because writing dynamic questions can be *significantly* different compared to static questions. The element of randomisation involved with each question results in many new issues that you may need to deal with.

In this section, I'll look at some issues that mainly occur in dynamic questions. Next, I'll go over a few general guidelines that can help you avoid these problems, so that your questions can be approved as quickly as possible.

The sections afterwards will focus on more specific, practical solutions to some of issues you might encounter when making questions themselves.
