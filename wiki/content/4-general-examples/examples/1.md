## Context: Volume of sphere given its SA

This is an **open-answer** question that involves giving the surface area (SA) of a sphere, and asking for its volume.

The general mathematics behind this is fairly straightforward. We can use the two formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere, given radius $$r$$: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
SA &= 4 \pi r^2 \\
V  &= {4 \pi r^3 \over 3}  \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The solution to this is to rearrange the top equation in terms of the radius $$r$$: 

$$
r = \sqrt{{SA \over 4 \pi}}
$$

And then substitute the resulting value into volume: 

$$
V = {4\pi \over 3} \cdot \bigg( \sqrt{{SA \over 4 \pi}} \bigg)^3 
$$

This looks a bit messy - but in fact, there's a pretty neat way to go about generating values for this question!

## Approach

The first thing to note is the formulas for SA and Volume: \
**If radius is a whole number**, surface area and volume may be expressed **exactly in terms of pi**. 

So rather than generating surface area or volume, what we could instead do is **generate an integer value for the radius**, and calculate the other resulting values. 

For students, this makes the question consistently solvable in a tidy manner; for us, it makes the question much easier to code - we can avoid dealing with square roots and rounding decimals!

{{<hint info>}}
When writing questions, the randomised values don't necessarily have to be what's shown to the student. You could go backwards instead - generate the answer first, and calculate the values to display!

In this case, we generated a value in the middle (the radius) and used that to calculate both the SA (displayed to the viewer) and the volume (the solution).

There's no predefined way to go about doing this - you can generate the values however you want, but do aim to keep the values in a question simple (as noted in [section 2.2.1](/2-design/guidelines#221-context)), as it tends to make your questions clearer and easier to code! 
{{</hint>}}

There are a few other things to note: 

1. The formula for the answer (volume), as $${4 \over 3} \pi r^3$$, will need to be formatted either as a fraction or as a whole number, depending on the value of $$r$$. Below, I'll show two ways of achieving this - either manually after checking whether the numerator is divisible by 3, or using a LibDQ function.

2. We should specify in the question **how** we want the answer to be formatted - such as whether to round the answer, or to provide a value exactly in terms of $$\pi$$. In this case, I went with the latter option as it requires students to think more carefully about the formulas involved (this is also easier to code :P).

## Coding the Question

First, as noted above, let's make our random value the radius of the sphere - since volume is based on radius cubed, we should be careful not to let the random values vary too much: 

```php
$radius = mt_rand(5, 15);
```

From `$radius`, we can calculate the values of sphere's SA and volume, <u>in terms of pi</u>. 

SA is straightforward, but volume needs to deal with the case where the fraction can be simplified: 

```php
$sa = 4 * pow($radius, 2);            // in terms of pi

$vol_numer = 4 * pow($radius, 3);     // numerator, in terms of pi
if ($vol_numer % 3 == 0) {
    $vol = $vol_numer / 3;
} else {
    $vol = "$vol_numer / 3";
}
```

Note that alternatively, we could use a LibDQ function `gen_frac()` to help us with formatting: 

```php
$sa = 4 * pow($radius, 2);            // in terms of pi

$vol_numer = 4 * pow($radius, 3);     // numerator, in terms of pi
$vol = _MD('lib_dq')::gen_frac($vol_numer, 3);
```

In this case, to make the code usable even on local machines where LibDQ isn't defined, I'll go with the former.

{{<hint info>}}
Here, we've not actually stored the *real* values of SA or volume in any of the variables. Instead, The values of `$sa` and `$vol` are set up so that we can display them properly in strings that use AsciiMath - e.g. `` `$vol pi` ``.

For example, if `$radius` was set to `5`, then `$vol` would be the string `"500 / 3"`. 

We could set this in questions as `` `$vol pi` ``, which would be `` `500 / 3 pi` `` and rendered as $${500 \over 3} \pi$$.
{{</hint>}}

Next, generate the question text, making sure to include AsciiMath where appropriate, as well as how the answer should be formatted: 

```php
$question_text = "A sphere has surface area `$sa pi`. What is its volume? Express your answer in exact terms with `pi`.";
```

Finally, we can express our answer and generate our solution text. I've separated out the solution text into multiple lines through `<br>`, and have formatted the solution to look similar to how it would be displayed.

```php
$answer = "`$vol pi`";

$solution = "The formula for calculating the surface area and volume of a sphere both depend on radius: <br>"
          . "`SA = 4 pi r^2` <br>"
          . "`V = 4/3 pi r^3` <br>"
          . "We can solve for radius by rearranging the formula for surface area, and substitute this into the formula for volume: <br>"
          . "`r = sqrt((SA) / (4pi)) = sqrt(($sa pi) / (4pi)) = $radius` <br>"
          . "Therefore, `V = 4/3 pi r^3 = 4/3 pi ($radius)^3 = $vol pi`.";
```

And finally, echo the question text itself (since this is the question box):

```php
echo $question_text;
```

## Final Question Code

When coding questions, I tend to put all the random generation together in the question box - this makes it clear where all the variables are coming from and how they're generated. 

Therefore, the code in the question box: 

{{<highlight PHP "linenos=true">}}
<?php

$radius = mt_rand(5, 20);

$sa = 4 * pow($radius, 2);            // in terms of pi
$vol_numer = 4 * pow($radius, 3);     // numerator, in terms of pi
if ($vol_numer % 3 == 0) {
    $vol = $vol_numer / 3;
} else {
    $vol = "$vol_numer / 3";
}

$question_text = "A sphere has surface area `$sa pi`. What is its volume? Express your answer in exact terms with `pi`.";
$answer = "`$vol pi`";

$solution = "The formula for calculating the surface area and volume of a sphere both depend on radius: <br>"
          . "`SA = 4 pi r^2` <br>"
          . "`V = 4/3 pi r^3` <br>"
          . "We can solve for radius by rearranging the formula for surface area, and substitute this into the formula for volume: <br>"
          . "`r = sqrt((SA) / (4pi)) = sqrt(($sa pi) / (4pi)) = $radius` <br>"
          . "Therefore, `V = 4/3 pi r^3 = 4/3 pi ($radius)^3 = $vol pi`.";

echo $question_text;    // echo the actual question text
?>
{{</highlight>}}

The code in the answer and solution is therefore very short: 

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
echo $answer;
?>
{{</highlight>}}

{{<highlight php "linenos=true">}}
<?php
echo $solution;
?>
{{</highlight>}}
