title: 1.1. What are Dynamic Questions?
---

Dynamic questions are used when we have a good conceptual question that we'd like to ask repeatedly, with different valued constants each time the question is displayed. In these cases, code can be used to randomise certain parameters in the question, and then generate the corresponding question text, answers, and solutions.

An example of a dynamic question, viewed several times, is shown below: 

{{<tabs "results">}}
{{<tab "Example 1">}} <img width=600px src="https://i.imgur.com/lUKXHyh.png"/> {{</tab>}}
{{<tab "Example 2">}} <img width=600px src="https://i.imgur.com/XAb0rx2.png"/> {{</tab>}}
{{<tab "Example 3">}} <img width=600px src="https://i.imgur.com/KRejzV6.png"/> {{</tab>}}
{{</tabs>}}

As you can see in the above images, the question changes each time the question is viewed, with different answers and solutions to go with the quadratic equation. 

> There's a lot of good uses for dynamic questions - for one, they're an efficient way of providing diverse experiences to students as they build mathematical skills. More context behind the 'why' on these questions will be covered in section [2.2.1. Context](#221-context).
