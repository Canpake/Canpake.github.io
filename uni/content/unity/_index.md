### Description
(A shooter game for my CS dissertation.)

Face increasingly difficult waves of procedurally generated enemies in this vertical SHMUP! Go near bullets and collect energy to charge up your AUGMENT gauge, and use it to unleash strong attacks while further strengthening your own deck.

Points are earned based on enemies destroyed and bombs conserved; survive as long as you can and destroy as many enemies as possible to aim for the high score.

### Controls
- Arrow keys to move
- Space to shoot
- **C** to use a bomb; this creates a wide radial blast that destroys both enemies and projectiles.
- **ENTER** to begin the AUGMENT mode. While in this mode, time is slowed down, and 3 cards from your AUGMENT deck are chosen for you to pick from. 
- **Z** to use the AUGMENT card selected. 

### Some additional notes
When you empty out your AUGMENT deck (indicated when the REMAIN counter reaches 0), your level rises, and the next AUGMENT card you choose will be upgraded to its 'plus' version - e.g. BLOCK to BLOCK+. 

Your AUGMENT gauge increases naturally over time, but you can raise it in 2 other ways:
* Collecting the pickups from destroyed enemies
* Getting close to enemy bullets without being hit, indicated by a small 'graze' icon

### Survey?
I'd like to do a user study of sorts where I record down people's thoughts on the game. If you have several minutes to spare, I'd really appreciate it if you could let me know how you found it!
